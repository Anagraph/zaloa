Zaloa
=====

Zaloa takes input terrain tiles, and merges them together.

It is designed to be run as middleware to dynamically generate alternate tile sizes from 256px sources.

Sizes and tilesets
------------------

Zaloa uses two tilesets as its source:

1. terrarium
2. normal

### Terrarium

Supports 512, and buffered variants of 256, namely 260 and 516. The variants have a 2 pixel buffer on each edge.

### Normal

Supports 512. Normal tiles do not have buffered variants.

Tile Generation
---------------

The larger tiles are generated by sourcing the relevant neighbors from the 256px sources.

In the diagrams below, `o` is the source tile, and the `x`s represent the neighbors used.

### 512

```
o x
x x
```

### 260

```
x x x
x o x
x x x
```

### 516

```
x x x x
x O o x
x o o x
x x x x
```

Edge Cases
----------

When on the "edge", there isn't a neighboring tile to source. Zaloa's behavior is:

* column edge: wrap around and use the tile from the other "side".

eg: The left neighbor of 2/0/2 will be 2/3/2

* row edge: the source tile is "copied" into the necessary location.

eg: The top neighbor of 2/2/0 is 2/2/0 itself, ie the top 2 rows of pixels are re-used as the buffer.
